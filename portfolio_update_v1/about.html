        <h2 class="header-two-about"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Personal Life</span></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Zuckerberg met his future wife, fellow student <a>Priscilla Chan</a>, at a fraternity party during his sophomore year at Harvard.
            They began dating in 2003.</p>
        <p>In September 2010, Zuckerberg invited Chan, by then a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco,[164] to move into his rented Palo Alto house. Zuckerberg studied Mandarin in preparation for the couple's visit to China in December 2010.[165][166] On May 19, 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan married in Zuckerberg's backyard in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.[167][168][169] On July 31, 2015, Zuckerberg announced that he and Chan were expecting a baby girl. He said he felt confident that the risk of miscarrying was low so far into the pregnancy, after Chan had already suffered three miscarriages.[170] On December 1, Zuckerberg announced the birth of their daughter, Maxima Chan Zuckerberg ("Max").[171][172] The couple announced on their Chinese New Year video,
            published on February 6, 2016, that Maxima's official Chinese
            name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: 陈明宇). In March 2017, he announced that the two are expecting another
            daughter.</p>
        <p>While raised Jewish, Zuckerberg later identified as an atheist, a position he has since renounced. He has
            shown an appreciation for Buddhism. With regard to Christianity, both Zuckerberg and his wife told Pope
            Francis in August 2016 "how much we admire his message of mercy and tenderness, and how he's found new ways
            to communicate with people of every faith around the world."In December 2016, when asked "Aren't you an atheist?"
            in response to a Christmas Day post on Facebook, Zuckerberg responded, "No. I was raised Jewish and then I went
            through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important." As he closed his
            commencement address at Harvard University in May 2017, Zuckerberg shared the Jewish prayer Mi Shebeirach,
            which he stated he says when he faces challenges in life.</p>

        <h2 class="header-two-about"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Early Life</span></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Zuckerberg was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York. He is the son of Karen (née Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg,
        a dentist. His ancestors came from Germany, Austria and Poland. He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and Arielle, were brought
        up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County village about 21 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. Zuckerberg was raised Jewish
        and had his Bar Mitzvah when he turned 13.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. He transferred to the exclusive private school Phillips Exeter Academy, in New
        Hampshire, in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (math, astronomy, and physics) and classical studies. In his youth, he
        also attended the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg claimed that he could
        read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team</p>

        <h2 class="header-two-about"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Software Developer</span></h2>
        <h3>Early years</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught
            him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him
            privately. Newman calls him a "prodigy", adding that it was "tough to stay ahead of him". Zuckerberg took a
            graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. He enjoyed
            developing computer programs, especially communication tools and games. In one program, since his father's
            dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed
            all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a
            "primitive" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">According to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, "some kids played computer games. Mark created
            them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come
            over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." However, notes Vargas, Zuckerberg was not a typical
            "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Parker">Sean Parker</a>, a close
            friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once
            quoted lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.</p>

        <h3>College years</h3>
        <p>Vargas noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard, he had already achieved a
            "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to
            Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House. In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch,
            which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to
            help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash
            that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's
            roommate at the time, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:</p>
            <q>We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the
                student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two
                females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would
                be a ranking.</q>
        <p>The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed
            one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students
            complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student
            paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."</p>
        <p>The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new Web site.[31] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg
            launched "Thefacebook", originally located at <strong>thefacebook.com.</strong></p>
