        <h1 class="headers-experience">Time at Harvard</h1>
        <p>After graduating from Exeter in 2002, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University. By his sophomore year at the ivy league
          institution, he had developed a reputation as the go-to software developer on campus. It was at that time that he built a
          program called CourseMatch, which helped students choose their classes based on the course selections of other users. He
          also invented Facemash, which compared the pictures of two students on campus and allowed users to vote on which one was
          more attractive. The program became wildly popular, but was later shut down by the school administration after it was
          deemed inappropriate. Based on the buzz of his previous projects, three of his fellow students—Divya Narendra, and twins
          Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss—sought him out to work on an idea for a social networking site they called Harvard Connection.</p>

        <p>This site was designed to use information from Harvard's student networks in order to create a dating site for the Harvard
          elite. Zuckerberg agreed to help with the project, but soon dropped out to work on his own social networking site with friends
          Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin. Zuckerberg and his friends created a site that allowed users to create
          their own profiles, upload photos, and communicate with other users. The group ran the site—first called The Facebook—out of a
          dorm room at Harvard until June 2004. After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg dropped out of college to devote himself to Facebook
          full time, moving the company to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had 1 million users.</p>

        <h1 class="headers-experience">The Rise of Facebook</h1>
        <p>In 2005, Zuckerberg's enterprise received a huge boost from the venture capital firm Accel Partners. Accel invested $12.7 million into the network,
          which at the time was open only to ivy league students. Zuckerberg's company then granted access to other colleges, high school and international
          schools, pushing the site's membership to more than 5.5 million users by December 2005. The site then began attracting the interest of other companies,
          who wanted to advertise with the popular social hub. Not wanting to sell out, Zuckerberg turned down offers from companies such as Yahoo! and MTV
          Networks. Instead, he focused on expanding the site, opening up his project to outside developers and adding more features.</p>

          <p>Zuckerberg seemed to be going nowhere but up, however in 2006, the business mogul faced his first big hurdle. The creators of Harvard Connection
          claimed that Zuckerberg stole their idea, and insisted the software developer needed to pay for their business losses. Zuckerberg maintained that the
          ideas were based on two very different types of social networks but, after lawyers searched Zuckerberg's records, incriminating Instant Messages
          revealed that Zuckerberg may have intentionally stolen the intellectual property of Harvard Connection and offered Facebook users' private information
          to his friends.</p>

          <p>Zuckerberg later apologized for the incriminating messages, saying he regretted them. "If you're going to go on to build a service that is
          influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right?" he said in an interview with The New Yorker. <q>"I think I've grown
            and learned a lot."</q></p>
